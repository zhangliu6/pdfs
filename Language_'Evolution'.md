The other day I had a wild guess (you could call it a hypothesis/postulate) about natural language and artificial language. Since the AI learning algorithm is modelled after human intelligence, we could draw some insights as to how humans have developed our natural language. As shown below, one language branches out to form ‘new language varieties’ due to language contact. And then eventually these varieties of language become new languages when there are sufficient differences from the origin language. Probably co-incidentally, we observe the same trend on the Asian continent - ancient Chinese spread to and eventually evolved into Japanese and Korean languages.

So my hypothesis is that give sufficient time, a variety of language will eventually and definitely becomes a language on its own. This hypothesis, if proven right, could be extended to artificial language (the language people purposely create) and AI language (the new variety that AI develops). (probably programming language as well? I don’t know.)

After having a vague idea, I had a conversation with a chemistry teacher. He actually used the chemical equilibrium and thermodynamics model to predict that in the future there might be only one universal language in the world. This is because like a reaction system, the complexity of language is initially low (only one original proto-indo-european language) and then increases (many different languages is developed) and eventually approaches homogeneity (maximum randomness), when it tends towards a single language that is like a ‘rojak’. [this is disputable but even some researchers also have similar ideas, out of different reasons]
