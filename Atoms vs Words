> Discourses are structures of **possibility** and **constraint**. (Foucault)

Atoms are the building blocks of molecules. 

Words are the building blocks of sentences. 

Hypothetically, there can be infinite number of combinations of atoms to form molecules and, likewise, permutations of words are infinite. 

However, in both cases, possibilities are constrained by external factors - temperature, pressure, properties of the atoms for the former and syntax, logic, context for the latter.
