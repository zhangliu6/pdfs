I believe that a futuristic attitude is sometimes crucial in AI research, and perhaps any other R&D as well. George Orwell said, “He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.” In the field of AI, he who controls the future controls the present. 

The pre-requisite for being futuristic is most of the times being curious and being bold. Things might fail because there is no precedence. 

And for an idea to survive, it is crucial not to be too quick to judge. Critical thinking is definitely valuable, but being too critical at the very beginning can sometimes stifle inspirations.
